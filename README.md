# **MLB Win Prediction Using Statistical Modeling** ⚾

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages over 100 years of Major League Baseball (MLB) team statistics to predict the number of wins a team can achieve in a season. The analysis integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and statistical modeling to uncover the most influential factors contributing to team performance.

## **Highlights**
- **Dataset**: Utilized the **Lahman Baseball Database** (1871–2019).
- **Objective**: Predict team wins using batting, pitching, and contextual team stats.
- **Techniques**: 
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection.
  - Exploratory data analysis to identify historical trends and anomalies.
  - Modeling with **Linear Regression** and performance comparison with **Random Forests**.
- **Key Metrics**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Adjusted R-squared to evaluate model accuracy.

## **Key Insights**
- Incorporating advanced features like run differentials significantly improved prediction accuracy (RMSE: ±4.6 wins).
- Adjusting historical data to align with modern baseball standards enhanced model reliability.
- Identified trends in batting and pitching stats over time, enabling future projections based on evolving gameplay.

## **Results**
- **Final Model**: Linear Regression with batting, pitching, and run differential metrics achieved:
  - RMSE: **4.58**
  - Adjusted R-squared: **0.89**
- The model demonstrates robust predictive capabilities, offering practical insights for baseball analytics and strategy optimization.

## **Tech Stack**
- **R Programming**: Data manipulation, visualization, and model development.
- **Libraries**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, and more.

## **Repository Contents**
- `Win_Prediction_for_Baseball.R`: Full codebase for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
- `Report.pdf`: Detailed project report with analysis, methodology, and results.

## **Future Work**
- Predict individual player contributions to team wins.
- Explore advanced machine learning models for greater predictive power.
- Analyze recent trends in MLB, such as the impact of exit velocity and launch angles.
